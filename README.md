# Wormtown-Escape-Practice
A pygame-based practice minigame based on the escape mechanics from "Last Train Outta' Wormtown"
---
### Notes
- Currently the game starts messed up upon running. After completing one succesful direction it should fix itself
- Please let me know of any PC-related visual issues (I tried to make it fit to any screen)
